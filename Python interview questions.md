### Ques. What is a dynamically typed language?
Type-checking can be done at two stages:-
1. **Static-** Data Types are checked before execution.
2. **Dynamic-** Data Types are checked during execution.
Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.

### Ques. Is indentation required in python?
Indentation is necessary for Python. It specifies a block of code. All code within loops, classes, functions, etc is specified within an indented block. It is usually done using four space characters. If your code is not indented necessarily, it will not execute accurately and will throw errors as well.

### Ques. What are the common built-in data types in Python?
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
* **Numeric:-**
   * Integers :- int stores integers eg a=100, b=25, c=526, etc.
   * Float :- float stores floating-point numbers eg a=25.6, b=45.90, c=1.290, etc.
   * Complex Numbers:- complex stores numbers eg a=3 + 4j, b=2 + 3j, c=complex(4,6), etc.
   * long:- long stores higher range of integers eg a=908090999L, b=-0x1990999L, etc.

* **Sequence Type:-**
   * String
   * List
   * Tuple
   * range

* **Boolean:-** There can be only two types of value in the Boolean data type of Python, and that is True or False. 
* Set Type:-
  *  set:-
  *  frozenset:-
* **Dictionary**
* **long:-** long stores higher range of integers eg a=908090999L, b=-0x1990999L, etc.

* **Mapping Types:-**
  * dict:- Stores comma-separated list of key: value pairs.
* **Binary Types:-**
  * bytes
  * bytearray
  * memoryview 


* We can get the data type of any object by using the __type()__ function.
```python
x = 5
print(type(x)) 

output:- <class 'int'>
```

### Ques. How to get Id()?
id() function takes a single parameter object.
```python
a = 5
print(id(a))
```

### Ques. Type Casting / Type Conversion
* Jab bhi hum ek data type ki value ko dusre data type ki value mai convert karte hai to usi ko hum bolte hai type conversion.
```python
# int 

x = int(1)
y = int(2.8)
z = int("3")
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:-
1
2
3

# Flot
x = float(1)
y = float(2.8)
z = float("3")
w = float("4.2")
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
print(w)

Output:-
1.0
2.8
3.0
4.2

# String
x = str("s1")
y = str(2)
z = str(3.0)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:-
s1
2
3.0
```

### Ques. What do * (single asterisk) and ** (double asterisk) do for parameters in Python?
* <b>Single Asterisk:-</b>Single Asterisk allows the developer to pass a variable number of Positional parameters and automatically converts the input values in the form of tuples. At the same time.
```python
def print_colors(*args):
    print(args)
print_colors('red','blue','green','yellow')

Output:- ('red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow')
```
* <b>Double Asterisks</b> allows the users to pass a variable number of Keyword parameters in the form of a Dictionary. 
```python
def print_numbers(**kwargs):
  for key in kwargs:
      print (key, kwargs[key])
print_numbers(one=1, two="two",three=3,four="four")

Output:-
one 1
four four
two two
three 3
```

### Ques. Python Shallow Copy and Deep Copy?
__Deep Copy:-__ In deep copy any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the orginal object.
```python
import copy

old_list = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)

new_list[1][0] = 'BB'

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)

Output:- 
Old list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
New list: [[1, 1, 1], ['BB', 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
```
__Shallow copy:-__ A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements.
```python
 import copy

old_list = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)

new_list[1][1] = 'AA'

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)

Output:- 
Old list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 'AA', 2], [3, 3, 3]]
New list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 'AA', 2], [3, 3, 3]]
```

### Ques. How is memory managed in Python?
* Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.
* Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead.
* The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.

### Ques. Global Keyword?
In Python, global keyword allows you to modify the variable outside of the current scope. It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.<br>
__Rules of global Keyword__
 * When we create a variable inside a function, it is local by default.
 * When we define a variable outside of a function, it is global by default. You don't have to use global keyword.
 * We use global keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function.
 __Example__
```python
 def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)

Output:-Python is fantastic
```

```python
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)
```
output:-Python is fantastic

### Python Collections (Arrays)?
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
 * __List__ is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
 * __Tuple__ is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
 * __Set__ is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
 * __Dictionary__ is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

#### Ques. a=1, b=1 does both have same Id or not?
Two variables in Python have same id, but not lists.
```python
a = 10
b = 10
print(id(a))
print(id(b))

Output:- 
9788992
9788992
---------------------------------------------
# In List
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is b)

Output:- False
---------------------------------------------------
# In tuples
a = (1, 2, 3)
b = (1, 2, 3)
print(a is b)

Output:- True
```

### Ques. What is If Else?
* Equals: a == b
* Not Equals: a != b
* Less than: a < b
* Less than or equal to: a <= b
* Greater than: a > b
* Greater than or equal to: a >= b

```python
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
output:- a is greater than b
```

* __Short Hand If__
```python
a = 200
b = 33

if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
output:- "a is greater than b"
```

* __Short Hand If ... Else__
```python
a = 2
b = 330

print("A") if a > b else print("B")
output:- B
```

* One line if else statement, __with 3 conditions:__
```python
a = 330
b = 330

print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
Output:- =
```

* The __and__ keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements.
```python
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")
output:- Both conditions are True
```

* The __Or__ keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements.
```python
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")
output:- At least one of the conditions is True
```

* __Nested If__ You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
```python
x = 41

if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")
Output:- 
Above ten,
and also above 20!
```

* __The pass Statement__ if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
```python
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
Output:- 
```

### Ques. What is Lambda/Anonymous Function?
* A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
* In Python, an anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.
* While normal functions are defined using the **def** keyword in Python, anonymous functions are defined using the **lambda** keyword.
```python
def add(a,b):
print(a+b)
add(5,10)

# Using Lambda function
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(5))

Output:- 15
```

```python
# You can use lambda function in filter()
# filter() function is used to filter a given iterable (list like object) using another function that defines the filtering logic.
# Syntex:- filter(object, iterable)
# The object here should be a lambda function which returns a boolean value.
mylist = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
list_new  = list(filter(lambda x : (x%2==0), mylist))
print(list_new)

Output:- [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can use lambda function in map()
# map() function applies a given function to all the itmes in a list and returns the result. Similar to filter(), simply pass the lambda function and the list (or any iterable, like tuple) as arguments.

mylist = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
list_new  = list(map(lambda x : x%2, mylist))
print(list_new)

Output:- [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can use lambda function in reduce() as well
# reduce() function performs a repetitive operation over the pairs of the elements in the list. Pass the lambda function and the list as arguments to the reduce() function. For using the reduce() function, you need to import reduce from functools librray.

from functools import reduce
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
sum = reduce((lambda x,y: x+y), list1)
print(sum)

Output:- 45 //i.e 1+2, 1+2+3 , 1+2+3+4 and so on.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to use lambda function to manipulate a Dataframe
# You can also manipulate the columns of the dataframe using the lambda function. It’s a great candidate to use inside the apply method of a dataframe. I will be trying to add a new row in the dataframe in this section as example.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],columns = ['First','Second','Third'])
df['Forth']= df.apply(lambda row: row['First']*row['Second']* row['Third'], axis=1)
df
```
Output:- 
|   | First | Second | Third | Forth |
| 0 |  1    |    2   |   3   |  6    |
| 1 |  4    |  5     |   6   |  120  | 
                        
                       

### Ques:- What is Python JSON?
 * JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
 * JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
 * Python has a built-in package called json, which can be used to work with JSON data.
 
 __Convert JSON to Python__<br>If you have a JSON string, you can parse it by using the __json.loads()__ method.
 
```python
import json
# some JSON:
x = '{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'
y = json.loads(x)
# the result is a Python dictionary:
print(y["age"])
 
Output:- 30
```
__Convert Python to JSON__<br>If you have a Python object, you can convert it into a JSON string by using the __json.dumps()__ method.
```python
 import json

# a Python object (dict):
x = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}

# convert into JSON:
y = json.dumps(x)

# the result is a JSON string:
print(y)

Output:- {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

### Ques. What is Decorators?
* Decorators are used to add some design patterns to a function without changing its structure.
* A decorator function is a function that accepts a function as parameter and return a function(decorator ek function hai jo as a argument leta bhi function hai and return bhi function karta hai).
* Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

```python
def decor(fun):
    def inner():
        print('befor inhance')
        fun()
        print('after inhance')
    return inner
    
def num():
    print('hello mohit')

result = decor(num)
result()

# Example2:- 
def decor(fun1):
    def inner():
        print('befor inhance')
        fun1()
        print('after inhance')
    return inner
    
@decor   
def num():
    print('hello mohit')
    
num()


Output:-
befor inhance
hello mohit
after inhance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def num_decor(num):
    def inner():
        a = num()
        add = a + 5
        return add
    return inner
    
@num_decor
def num():
    return 10

print(num())

Output:- 15

# Example:-
def num_decor(num):
    def inner():
        a = num()
        add = a + 5
        return add
    return inner

def num():
    return 10

result = num_decor(num)
print(result())


Output:- 15
```


### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) 
* Class
* Objects
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Data Abstraction
  

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
### Ques.  What is Class?
* The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.
* To define a class in Python, you can use the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, an __init__ method has to be defined with def. This is the initializer that you can later use to instantiate objects. It's similar to a constructor in Java. __init__ must always be present! It takes one argument: self, which refers to the object itself. Inside the method, the pass keyword is used as of now, because Python expects you to type something there.

```python
class ClassName:     
  <statement-1>     
            .     
            .      
  <statement-N>
```

* **Instantiating object**
```python
mohit = ClassName()
print(mohit)
```

__Example__
```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
```

__Example__
```python
class Dog:

    def __init__(self, name, age):  
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print("bark bark!")

    def doginfo(self):
        print(self.name + " is " + str(self.age) + " year(s) old.")
        
ozzy = Dog("Ozzy", 2)
skippy = Dog("Skippy", 12)
filou = Dog("Filou", 8)

ozzy.bark()
skippy.doginfo()
filou.doginfo()

Output:-
bark bark!
Skippy is 12 year(s) old.
Filou is 8 year(s) old.
```

* we have shown two ways of accessing the values of those attributes. One, by directly using the class name and the other by using an object(class instance). Assigning a class to a variable is known as object instantiation.
```python
class Scaler:
    Course1 = 'Python'
    Course2 = 'C++'
    Course3 = 'Java'
# Accessing the values of the attributes
print(Scaler.Course1)
print(Scaler.Course3)
# Accessing through object instantiation.
obj= Scaler()
print(obj.Course2)

Output:-
Python
Java
C++
```

* If we change the value of the attribute using the class name, then it would change across all the instances of that class. While if we change the value of an attribute using class instance(object instantiation), it would only change the value of the attribute in that instance only.
```python
class Scaler:
    Course = 'Python'
# Changing value using Class Name
Scaler.Course = 'Machine Learning'
obj= Scaler()
print(obj.Course)
# Changing value using Class Instance 
obj.Course = 'AI'
print(obj.Course)   # Value will change in this instance only
print('Using class instance would not reflect the changes to other instances')
print(Scaler.Course) # Value haven't changed
obj2= Scaler()
print(obj2.Course)   # Value haven't changed

Output:- 
Machine Learning
AI
Using class instance would not reflect the changes to other instances
Machine Learning
Machine Learning
```

### Ques. What is Object?
* The object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.
* **For example:** if you have an employee class, then it should contain an attribute and method, i.e. an email id, name, age, salary, etc.
  
```python
class car:
    a = "mohit"
    def __init__(self,modelname, year):  
        self.modelname = modelname  
        self.year = year  
    def display(self):  
        print(self.modelname,self.year)  
  
c1 = car("Toyota", 2016)  
print(c1.a)             # Accessing Object's variables
c1.display()            # Accessing Object's functions

output:- 
mohit
Toyota 2016
```

* Modifying Object's properties
```python
class Scaler:
  a = 10

# Declaring an object
obj1 = Scaler()
print(obj1.a)

#Modifying value
obj1.a = 200
print("After modifying the object properties")
print(obj1.a) 

Output:-
10
After modifying the object properties
200
```


* Here, the <strong>self</strong> is used as a reference variable, which refers to the current class object. It is always the first argument in the function definition. However, using self is optional in the function call.
* The <strong>self-parameter</strong> refers to the current instance of the class and accesses the class variables. We can use anything instead of self, but it must be the first parameter of any function which belongs to the class

### Ques. Delete the Object?
We can delete the properties of the object or object itself by using the del keyword. Consider the following example.
```python
class Employee:  
  id = 10  
  name = "John"  
  def display(self):  
    print("ID: %d \nName: %s" % (self.id, self.name))  
      # Creating a emp instance of Employee class  
      emp = Employee()  
  
      # Deleting the property of object  
      del emp.id  

      # Deleting the object itself  
      del emp  
      emp.display()
```

### Ques. What is the use of self in Python?
Self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. self is used in different places and often thought to be a keyword. But unlike in C++, self is not a keyword in Python.

### Ques.  What is __init__?
<b>__init__</b> is a contructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. All classes have a __init__ method associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from local variables.

```python
class Student:
   def __init__(self, fname, lname, age, section):
       self.firstname = fname
       self.lastname = lname
       self.age = age
       self.section = section
# creating a new object
stu1 = Student("Sara", "Ansh", 22, "A2")
```

### Ques. What is pass in Python?
* The pass keyword represents a null operation in Python.<br> Without the pass statement in the following code, we may run into some errors during code execution.
```python
def myEmptyFunc():
   # do nothing
   pass
myEmptyFunc()    # nothing happens
## Without the pass keyword
# File "<stdin>", line 3
# IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

### Ques. What is break, continue and pass in Python?
* <b>Break:- </b>The break statement terminates the loop immediately and the control flows to the statement after the body of the loop.
* <b>Continue:- </b>The continue statement terminates the current iteration of the statement, skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and the control flows to the next iteration of the loop.
* <b>Pass:-</b> As explained above, the pass keyword in Python is generally used to fill up empty blocks and is similar to an empty statement represented by a semi-colon in languages such as Java, C++, Javascript, etc.

### Python Access Modifiers
```python
#defining class Student
class Student:
    #constructor is defined
    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
        self.age = age             # public Attribute
        self._name = name          # protected Attribute 
        self.__salary = salary     # private Attribute

    def _funName(self):            # protected method
        pass
 
    def __funName(self):           # private method
        pass

# object creation
obj = Student('Mohit',53434)
```

##### Ques What is Inheritance?
* Inheritance is the ability to ‘inherit’ features or attributes from already written classes into newer classes we make.
* Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
* **Benefits:-** It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again.

```python
class house:   
    height = “572ft”                 # predefined attributes of a class
    architect = “John Doe”
  
    def display_height(self):
        print("This house is " + self.height)    # methods for displaying height
    def display_architect(self):
        print (“The architect is “ + self.architect)  # methods for displaying architect

# Driver Code
Bungalow = house()                   # object creation
print(Bungalow.height)                   # accessing class attributes
Bungalow.display_height()                # calling method through object
Bungalow.display_architect()             # calling method through object

Output:- 
572ft
This building is 572ft
The architect is John Doe
```

##### Types Of Inheritance?
* **Single Inheritance:-** Single Inheritance is the simplest form of inheritance where a single child class is derived from a single parent class.
```python
class parent:                  # parent class
    def func1:                   
        print(“Hello Parent”)
 
class child(parent):           # child class
    def func2:                 # we include the parent class
        print(“Hello Child”)   # as an argument in the child
                               # class
 
# Driver Code
test = child()                 # object created
test.func1()                   # parent method called via child object
test.func2()                   # child method called

Output:- 
Hello Parent
Hello Child
```

* **Multiple Inheritance:-** In multiple inheritance, a single child class is inherited from two or more parent classes. This means the child class has access to all the methods and attributes of all the parent classes.
```python
class parent1:                     # first parent class
    def func1:                   
        print(“Hello Parent1”)
 
class parent2:                     # second parent class
    def func2:                   
        print(“Hello Parent2”)
 
class parent3:                     # third parent class
    def func2:                     # the function name is same as parent2
        print(“Hello Parent3”)
 
class child(parent1, parent2, parent3):     # child class
    def func3:                     # we include the parent classes
        print(“Hello Child”)       # as an argument comma separated
                           
# Driver Code
test = child()        # object created
test.func1()          # parent1 method called via child
test.func2()          # parent2 method called via child instead of parent3
test.func3()          # child method called

Output:-
Hello Parent1
Hello Parent2
Hello Child
```

* **Multi-Level Inheritance:-** In multilevel inheritance, we go beyond just a parent-child relation. We introduce grandchildren, great-grandchildren, grandparents.
```python
class grandparent:                 # first level
    def func1:                   
        print(“Hello Grandparent”)
 
class parent(grandparent):         # second level
    def func2:                   
        print(“Hello Parent”)
 
class child(parent):               # third level
    def func3:                   
        print(“Hello Child”)   
                               
 
# Driver Code
test = child()                     # object created
test.func1()                       # 3rd level calls 1st level
test.func2()                       # 3rd level calls 2nd level
test.func3()                       # 3rd level calls 3rd level

Output:-
Hello Grandparent
Hello Parent
Hello Child
```

* **Hierarchical Inheritance:-** there are multiple derived child classes from a single parent class.
```python
class parent:                       # parent class
    def func1:                   
        print(“Hello Parent”)
 
class child1(parent):               # first child class
    def func2:                   
        print(“Hello Child1”)
 
 
class child2(parent):               # second child class
    def func3:                   
        print(“Hello Child2”)   
                               
 
# Driver Code
test1 = child1()                     # objects created
test2 = child2() 
 
test1.func1()                       # child1 calling parent method
test1.func2()                       # child1 calling its own method
 
test2.func1()                       # child2 calling parent method
test2.func3()                       # child2 calling its own method

Output:-
Hello Parent
Hello Child1
Hello Parent
Hello Child2
```

* **Hybrid Inheritance:-** Hybrid Inheritance is the mixture of two or more different types of inheritance. Here we can have many to many relations between parent classes and child classes with multiple levels.
```python
class parent1:                            # first parent class
    def func1:                   
        print(“Hello Parent”)
 
 
class parent2:                            # second parent class
    def func2:                   
        print(“Hello Parent”)
 
class child1(parent1):                    # first child class
    def func3:                   
        print(“Hello Child1”)
 
 
class child2(child1, parent2):            # second child class
    def func4:                   
        print(“Hello Child2”)   
                               
 
# Driver Code
test1 = child1()                          # object created
test2 = child2()
 
test1.func1()                       # child1 calling parent1 method
test1.func2()                       # child1 calling its own method
 
test2.func1()                       # child2 calling parent1 method
test2.func2()                       # child2 calling parent2 method
test2.func3()                       # child2 calling child1 method
test2.func4()                       # child2 calling its own method

Output:-
Hello Parent1
Hello Child1

Hello Parent1
Hello Parent2
Hello Child1
Hello Child2
```

##### Public Access Modifier
* By default, all the variables and member functions of a class are public in a python program.
```python
class Employee:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, name, sal):
        self.name = name;
        self.sal = sal;
obj = Employee('mohit',555)
print(obj.name)
print(obj.sal)

Output:- 
Mohit
555
```

##### protected Access Modifier
adding a prefix _(single underscore) to a variable name makes it protected.
```python
class Employee:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, name, sal):
        self._name = name;   # protected attribute 
        self._sal = sal;     # protected attribute

obj = Employee('mohit',15)
print(obj._name)

Output:-
Mohit

# Example2:-
class Employee:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, name, sal):
        self._name = name;   # protected attribute 
        self._sal = sal;     # protected attribute
 
class HR(Employee):
    def task(self):
        print ("We manage Employees")
        

hrEmp = HR("Captain", 10000);
print(hrEmp._sal)
print(hrEmp.task())

Output:-
10000
We manage Employees
```

##### private Access Modifier
While the addition of prefix __(double underscore) results in a member variable or function becoming private.
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, height):
        self.name     = name   # public
        self._age     = age    # protected
        self.__height = height # private

p1 = Person("John", 20, 170)

print(p1.name)        # public: can be accessed
print(p1._age)        # protected: can be accessed but not advised
# print(p1.__height)  # private: will give AttributeError
```
	
	

### Ques. What is Generator Functions?
* Generator are functions that returns a sequens of value. we use yield statement to return the from function.
* Yield statement returns the element from a generator function into a genrater object.(EX:- yield a)
* This function is used to retrieve element by element from a generator object.(Ex:- next(gen_obj))
* A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values.
* In a generator function, a __yield__ statement is used rather than a return statement.
* The generator function cannot include the return keyword. If you include it, then it will terminate the function. 
* The difference between yield and return is that yield returns a value and pauses the execution while maintaining the internal states, whereas the return statement returns a value and terminates the execution of the function.

```python
def mygenerator():
    print('First item')
    yield 10

    print('Second item')
    yield 20

    print('Last item')
    yield 30

gen = mygenerator()
print(next(gen))
print(gen.__next__())  # 2 option to write the next function
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))

Output:- 
First item
10
Second item
20
Last item
30
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 22, in <module>
StopIteration

---------------------------------------------------------
# 2nd Option
gen = mygenerator()
while True:
    try:
        print ("Received on next(): ", next(gen))
    except StopIteration:
        break
Output:-
First item
Received on next():  10
Second item
Received on next():  20
Last item
Received on next():  30

# Example 2:-
def bhai(a,b):
    yield a+b
    yield a-b
result = bhai(3,2)
print(next(result))
print(next(result))

Output:- 
5
1

# Example 3:-
def numberPrint():
    n = 1
    while n <= 10:
        sq = n*n
        yield sq
        n += 1
values = numberPrint()
for i in values:
    print(i)

Output:-
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
```

### Ques. What is <b>__str__</b> and <b>__repr__</b> ?
* The repr() method returns a string containing a printable representation of an object. The repr() function calls the underlying __repr__() function of the object.
* The <b>__str__</b> method returns a string representation of an object that is human-readable while the 
* <b>__repr__</b> method returns a string representation of an object that is machine-readable.
	






### Ques. What is the difference between an array and a list?
| #   | List                                                              | Array                                                               |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | It Contains elements of different data types                      | It Contains elements of same data types                             |
| 2   | Cannot handle arithmetic operations                               | Can handle arithmetic operations                                    |
| 3   | We can print the entire list without the help of an explicit loop | To print or access array elements, we will require an explicit loop |
| 4   | It consumes a large memory                                        | It is a more compact in memory size comparatively list.             |




### How would you convert a list to an array?
* Python list is a linear data structure that can hold heterogeneous elements. Python does not have a built-in array data type. If you want to create an array in Python, then use the numpy library.
* To <em>install numpy</em> in your system, type the following command.
* python3 -m pip install numpy
* <strong>1. Using numpy.array()</strong>
```python
import numpy as np

elon_list = [11, 21, 19, 18, 29]
elon_array = np.array(elon_list)

print(elon_array)
print(type(elon_array))
                       
Output:- 
[11 21 19 18 29]
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>

# 2. Using numpy.asarray()
import numpy as np

elon_list = [11, 21, 19, 18, 29]
elon_array = np.asarray(elon_list)

print(elon_array)
print(type(elon_array))

Output:- [11 21 19 18 29]
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```       

			   
### Ques.  What is Method?
* The method is a function that is associated with an object. In Python, a method is not unique to class instances. Any object type can have methods.

### Ques. What is Inheritance?
Syntex:-
```python
class class-name(parent class):  
    <class-suite>  

class derive-class(<base class 1>, <base class 2>, ..... <base class n>):  
    <class - suite>  
```

### Ques. What is MRO(Method Resolution Order) / Diamond Problam?
* MRO is a concept used in inheritance.
* If a class is derived from more then one class, then it is called multiple inheritance.
* In Python, the MRO is from bottom to top and left to right. This means that, first, the method is searched in the class of the object. If it’s not found, it is searched in the immediate super class. In the case of multiple super classes, it is searched left to right, in the order by which was declared by the developer.

```python
class father():
    def showF(self):
        print("fathe class method")

class mother():
    def showM(self):
        print("mother class method")
class son(father, mother):
    def showS(self):
        print("son class method")

obj = son()
obj.showS()
obj.showF()
obj.showM()
------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example:-
class father():
    def display(self):
        print("father class method")

class mother():
    def display(self):
        print("mother class method")
        
        
class son(mother,father):                  # left to right 
    def showS(self):
        print("son class method")

obj = son()
obj.display()

Output:-
mother class method

++++++++++++++++++++
class son(father, mother):                  # left to right 
    def showS(self):
        print("son class method")

obj = son()
obj.display()

Output:- father class method
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Using Constructor
class father():
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()      # Calling Parent Class Constructor
        print("father class Constructor")
    def showF(self):
        print("father class method")

class mother():
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()      # Calling Parent Class Constructor
        print("mother class Constructor")
    def showM(self):
        print("mother class method")
class son(father, mother):                  # left to right 
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()      # Calling Parent Class Constructor 1st Wala
        print("son class Constructor")
    def showS(self):
        print("son class method")

obj = son()

Output:-
mother class Constructor
father class Constructor
son class Constructor
```


			

### Ques. What is Map, Filter, Reduce

### What is Iterators?
* iterator obj print the value one by one.
* An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
* An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.
* Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().
```python
# Example1
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

Output:-
apple
banana
cherry

# Example 2
mystr = "banana"
myit = iter(mystr)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

Output:- 
b
a
n
a
n
a

# Looping Through an Iterator
# The for loop actually creates an iterator object and executes the next() method for each loop
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for x in mytuple:
  print(x)

Output:-
apple
banana
cherry
```
### Difference between Iterators and iterable?


### Ques. Difference between generator and iterators in python?
| Iterator                                                                                            | Generator                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class is used to implement an iterator                                                              | Function is used to implement a generator.                                                                                                      |

### Ques. Types Of Methods In Python?
There are three types of methods in Python.
1. Instance Methods.
2. Class Methods.
3. Static Methods.

###### Instance Method
* when we create classes in python. If we want to print an instance variable or instance method we must create an object of that required class.
* If we are using self as a function parameter or in front of a variable, that is nothing but the calling instance itself.
* As we are working with instance variables we use self keyword.
* __Note:-__ Instance variables are used with instance methods.
```python
class Student:
    
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b 
    
    def avg(self):
        return (self.a + self.b) / 2

s1 = Student(10, 20)
print( s1.avg() )

Output:- 15.0
```
###### Class Method
* classsmethod() function returns a class method as output for the given function.
* If we want to create a class method we must use __@classmethod__ decorator and __cls__ as a parameter for that function.
```python
class Student:
    name = 'Student'
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b 
    
    @classmethod
    def info(cls):
        return cls.name

print(Student.info())

Output:- Student
```

###### Static Method
* A static method can be called without an object for that class, using the class name directly. If you want to do something extra with a class we use static methods.
* A static method in python must be created by decorating it with __@staticmethod__
```python
class Student:
    name = 'Student'
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b 
    
    @staticmethod
    def info():
        return "This is a student class"

print(Student.info())

Output:- This a student class
```
```python
class MethodTypes:

    name = "Ragnar"

    def instanceMethod(self):
        # Creates an instance atribute through keyword self
        self.lastname = "Lothbrock"
        print(self.name)
        print(self.lastname)

    @classmethod
    def classMethod(cls):
        # Access a class atribute through keyword cls
        cls.name = "Lagertha"
        print(cls.name)

    @staticmethod
    def staticMethod():
        print("This is a static method")

# Creates an instance of the class
m = MethodTypes()
# Calls instance method
m.instanceMethod()


MethodTypes.classMethod()
MethodTypes.staticMethod()

Output:-
Ragnar
Lothbrock
Lagertha
This is a static method
```




### Ques. What is Magic Method Or Dunder Methods?
* Magic methods in Python are the special methods that start and end with the double underscores. They are also called dunder methods.
* Built-in classes in Python define many magic methods.
* The dir() function can be used to see the number of magic methods inherited by a class.
```python
['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__bool__', '__ceil__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__divmod__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__float__', '__floor__', '__floordiv__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getnewargs__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__index__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__le__', '__lshift__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__or__', '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdivmod__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__round__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', '__truediv__', '__trunc__', '__xor__', 'bit_length', 'conjugate', 'denominator', 'from_bytes', 'imag', 'numerator', 'real', 'to_bytes']
```
```python
class emp():
    def __init__(self,name,salery):
        self.name = name
        self.salery = salery
        
    def __len__(self):             # Magic method
        return len(self.name)
        
obj = emp('mohit', 422573)
print(len(obj))

Output:- 5
```


##### Ques. What is a constructor in Python?
* In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.

**Types of constructors:**
1. **default constructor/Non-Parameterized Constructor:** The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesn’t accept any arguments. Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.
```python
class Shot:
    # Creating default constructor
    def __init__(self):
        print("This is a default constructor")
        self.title = "Constructor in Python"

    # a method to display the data member
    def display_message(self):
        print(self.title)

# creating object of the class
s1_obj = Shot()
s1_obj.display_message()

Output:-
This is a default constructor
Constructor in Python
```
2. **parameterized constructor:** constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.
```python
class Triangle:
    # parameterized constructor
    def __init__(self, b, h):
        self.base = b
        self.height = h

 
    def areaOfTriangle(self):
        self.area = self.base * self.height * 0.5
        print("Area of triangle: " + str(self.area))
 
# creating object of the class
# this will invoke parameterized constructor
obj = Triangle(5, 14)
obj.areaOfTriangle()

Output:-
Area of triangle: 35.0
```





### Reverse
list1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9]
print(list1[::-1])
list1.reverse()
print(list1)
list2 = []
for item in list1:
    list2.insert(0, item)
print(list2)    



*args and **kwargs in Python


##### String to array:-
```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
str1 = ' '.join(thislist)
counter = dict.fromkeys(str1, 0)
print(counter)
for item in str1:
    counter[item] += 1
print(counter)

import collections
print(collections.Counter("hello"))
```


### program to count the frequency of each character
```python
# using "in" operater
str1 = input ("Enter the string: ")
d = dict()
for c in str1:
    if c in d:
        d[c] = d[c] + 1
    else:
        d[c] = 1
print(d)

Output:- 
Enter the string: HheLlo
{'H': 1, 'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'L': 1, 'l': 1, 'o': 1}
Enter the string: Hello My name is Mohit Saxena
{'H': 1, 'e': 3, 'l': 2, 'o': 2, ' ': 5, 'M': 2, 'y': 1, 'n': 2, 'a': 3, 'm': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 1, 'h': 1, 't': 1, 'S': 1, 'x': 1}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use of “get()” function
```

```python
a = "mohit kumar"
new_list = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1,5,6,7]
list4 = []
for item in a:
    list4.append(item)
print(list4)
list5 = []
[list5.append(item*5) for item in new_list if item not in list5]
print(list5)
List = ['agffg', 'acmmmmmmmfgz', 'aaa', 'ababxa']
print(sorted(List))
dict1 = {}
# for item in List:
#   dict1[len(item)] = item
# print(dict1)
dict1 = {len(item): item  for item in List}
print(dict1)
abc = sorted(dict1)
list6 = [dict1[item] for item in abc]
print(list6)



### Meta Class in Models?
Model Meta is basically the inner class of your model class. Model Meta is basically used to change the behavior of your model fields like changing order options,verbose_name, and a lot of other options. It’s completely optional to add a Meta class to your model.
```python
class student(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        options........
```

##### Model Meta Options:-
1. abstract
   If abstract = True, this model will be an abstract  base class
```python
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      abstract = True
```

2. app_label
   If a model is defined outside of applications in INSTALLED_APPS, it must declare which app  it belongs to:
```python
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      app_label = 'myapp' # add app name here
```

3. verbose_name:- verbose_name is basically a human-readable name for your model
```python
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      verbose_name = "stu" # add verbose_name  here
```

4. ordering:- Ordering is basically used to change the order of your model fields.
```python
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      ordering = [-1]
```

5. proxy:- If we add proxy = True a model which subclasses another model will be treated as a proxy model
```python
class Student(Teacher):
  class Meta:
      proxy = True
```

6. permissions:- Extra permissions to enter into the permissions table when creating this object. Add, change, delete and view permissions are automatically created for each model.
```python
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      permissions = []
```

7. db_table:- We can overwrite the table name by using db_table in meta class.
```python
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      db_table = 'table_name'
```

8. get_latest_by:- It returns the latest object in the table based on the given field, used for typically DateField, DateTimeField, or IntegerField.
```python
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      get_latest_by = "order_date"
```


### Ques. What is File Handling in Python?
* Suppose you are working on a file saved on your personal computer. If you want to perform any operation on that file like opening it, updating it or any other operation on that, all that comes under File handling.
* Types Of File in Python
* Binary file
  * <b>Document files:</b> .pdf, .doc, .xls etc.
  * <b>Image files:</b> .png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp etc.
  * <b>Video files:</b> .mp4, .3gp, .mkv, .avi etc.
  * <b>Audio files:</b> .mp3, .wav, .mka, .aac etc.
  * <b>Database files:</b> .mdb, .accde, .frm, .sqlite etc.
  * <b>Archive files:</b> .zip, .rar, .iso, .7z etc.
  * <b>Executable files:</b> .exe, .dll, .class etc.
* Text file
  * <b>Web standards:</b>  html, XML, CSS, JSON etc.
  * Source code:</b> c, app, js, py, java etc.
  * Documents:</b> txt, tex, RTF etc.
  * Tabular data:</b> csv, tsv etc
  * Configuration:</b> ini, cfg, reg etc
  

#### Opening and Closing a File in Python?
**open() Function:-** This function takes two arguments. First is the filename along with its complete path, and the other is access mode. This function returns a file object.
```python
open(filename, mode)
```
Note:- By default, the access mode is read mode if you don't specify any mode. 

#### How to create a new file
* create a new file:- "x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist.
```python
f = open("myfile.txt", "x")
```

#### How to read file in python
* Open a File on the Server:- The open() function returns a file object, which has a **read() method** for reading the content of the file.
```python
file = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
file.close()
```
* By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return.
```python
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))

Output:- Hello
```

* The **readline() function** helps you read a **single** line from the file.
```python
file_obj = open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
print(file_obj.readline())
file_obj.close()

Output:-
Hello World
```

* As the name suggests, the **readlines() method** reads **all the lines** in the file and returns them properly separated in a list.
```python
file_obj = open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
print(file_obj.readlines())
file_obj.close()

Output:- 
This is a new file.
We have now learnt all read functions.
We are trying a new method 
to loop over files.
```


* **Close Files:-** It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.
```python
file = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
file.close()
```

#### How to Write a File in Python
* We're creating it using the **w** mode. Once we open the new file, it's obviously empty. We're then going to write content into it.
* Write - will overwrite any existing content and Create a new file if it does not exist.
```python
file_obj = open("writing.txt", "w")
```

* **a** Append - will append to the end of the file
```python
file = open("writing.txt", "a")
file.write("This way, I will preserve the existing contents in the file")
print(file.read())
file.close()
```

#### Delete File and folder?
* **Delete File** To delete a file, you must **import the OS module**, and run its os.remove() function
```python
import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")
-----------------------------
import os
if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
  os.remove("demofile.txt")
else:
  print("The file does not exist")
```

* **Delete Folder** To delete an entire folder, use the os.rmdir() method
* It can only remove empty folders.
```python
import os
os.rmdir("myfolder")
```


| Modes | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| r     | Opens a file in read-only mode. The pointer of the file is at the beginning of the file. This is also the default mode.                                      |
| rb    | Same as r mode, except this opens the file in binary mode.                                                                                                   |
| r+    | Opens the file for reading and writing. The pointer is at the beginning of the file.                                                                         |
| rb+   | Same as r+ mode, except this, opens the file in binary mode.                                                                                                 |
| w     | Opens the file for writing. Overwrites the existing file and if the file is not present, then creates a new one.                                             |
| wb    | Same as w mode, except this opens the file in binary format.                                                                                                 |
| w+    | Opens the file for both reading and writing, rest is the same as w mode.                                                                                     |
| wb+   | Same as w+ except this opens the file in binary format.                                                                                                      |
| a     | Opens the file for appending. If the file is present, then the pointer is at the end of the file, else it creates a new file for writing.                    |
| ab    | Same as a mode, except this opens the file in binary format.                                                                                                 |
| a+    | Opens the file for appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists, else it creates a new file for reading and writing. |
| ab+   | Same as a+ mode, except this, opens the file in binary format.                                                                                               |


#### using with statement?
* The method shown in the above section is not entirely safe. If some exception occurs while opening the file, then the code will exit without closing the file.
```python
# Opening file in read mode and printing the contents of the file.
with open("test.txt", mode='r') as f:
    data = f.readlines() #This reads all the lines from the file in a list.
    print(data) #This will print the content of the Hello World file!

# Opening a file in write mode.
with open("test.txt", mode='w') as f:
    f.write("Data after write operation")
# Opening file in read mode to check the contents.
with open("test.txt", mode='r') as f:
    data = f.readlines() # this reads all the lines from the file in a list.
    print(data) #this will print the overwritten content of the file that is       "Data after write operation"

# Opening a file in append mode and appending data to the file.
with open("test.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(" Appending new data to the file")
# Opening file in read mode to check the contents.
with open("test.txt", mode='r') as f:
    data = f.readlines() #This reads all the lines from the file in a list.
    print(data) #this will print the existing content of file plus the appended content
```

 What are pickling and unpickling in Python?


What are Python namespaces?
A namespace in python refers to the name which is assigned to each object in python. The objects are variables and functions. As each object is created, its name along with space(the address of the outer function in which the object is), gets created. The namespaces are maintained in python like a dictionary where the key is the namespace and value is the address of the object. There 4 types of namespace in python-

Built-in namespace– These namespaces contain all the built-in objects in python and are available whenever python is running.
Global namespace– These are namespaces for all the objects created at the level of the main program.
Enclosing namespaces– These namespaces are at the higher level or outer function.
Local namespaces– These namespaces are at the local or inner function.

Local Scope
The Variables which are defined in the function are a local scope of the variable. These variables are defined in the function body.
Example:- 
def myfunc():
  x = 300
  print(x)

myfunc()

Output:- 300

Global Scope
The Variable which can be read from anywhere in the program is known as a global scope. These variables can be accessed inside and outside the function. 
x = 300

def myfunc():
  print(x)

myfunc()

print(x)

Output:- 300
300

AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
The default User model in Django uses a username to uniquely identify a user during authentication. If you'd rather use an email address, you'll need to create a custom User model by either subclassing AbstractUser or AbstractBaseUser.

Options:

AbstractUser: Use this option if you are happy with the existing fields on the User model and just want to remove the username field.
AbstractBaseUser: Use this option if you want to start from scratch by creating your own, completely new User model.




What is CRUD operations Django?
Django is a Python-based web framework that follows the MVT (Model View Template) pattern and allows you to quickly create web applications. It offers built-in class-based generic views for CRUD operations. CRUD in general means Creating, Retrieving, Updating and Deleting operations on a table in a database.

What is class based view in Django?
Class-based view is an alternative to function-based view. They do not replace function-based views, but have some distinct differences and advantages over function-based views.

What is generic views in Django?
Django generic views have been developed as shortcuts for common usage methods such as displaying object details.
They take some of the common methods found in view development and abstract them so that you can quickly write common views of data without writing too much code.

What is DetailView in Django?
Django DetailView should be used when you want to present detail of a single model instance. Its purpose is to use with only one object.



class Employee(models.Model):
	id = models.AutoField('Id', primary_key=True)
	
	first_name = models.CharField('First name', max_length=15, null = True)
	last_name = models.CharField('Last name', max_length=16, blank=True)
	email = models.EmailField(max_length = 255, unique=True, null = True)
	user_name   = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True, null = True, error_messages ={
