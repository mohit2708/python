### Ques. What are the key features of Python?
* Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
* It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
* It is used for:
  * web development (server-side),
  * software development,
  * mathematics,
  * system scripting.
  
  
### Ques. Python Comments?
__single Line Comments__
```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
__Multi Line Comments__
```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Ques. Python Variables?
 * A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
 * A variable name cannot start with a number
 * A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
 * Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
```python
#Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

#Illegal variable names:
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```
__Example__
```python
x = 5
y = "Mohit"
print(x)
print(y)
```
output:- 5<br>Mohit
```python
# double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "saxena" # x is now of type str
x = 'mohit' # x is now of type str
print(x)
```
output:-Mohit

__Assign Value to Multiple Variables__
```python
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
output:- Orange<br>Banana<br>Cherry
```python
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
output:- Orange<br>Orange<br>Orange

__Output Variables(combine both text and a variable)__
```python
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)
```
output:- Python is awesome
```python
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)
```
output:-Python is awesome
```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
```
output:- 15<br>

Note:- If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
```
output:- TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

### Ques. Global Variables?
 * Variables that are created outside of a function.
 * Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
__Example:-__
```python
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()
```
output:- Python is awesome
```python
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)
```
output:- Python is fantastic<br>Python is awesome

### Ques. Global Keyword?
In Python, global keyword allows you to modify the variable outside of the current scope. It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.<br>
__Rules of global Keyword__
 * When we create a variable inside a function, it is local by default.
 * When we define a variable outside of a function, it is global by default. You don't have to use global keyword.
 * We use global keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function.
 __Example__
 ```python
 def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)
 ```
 Output:-Python is fantastic
  ```python
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)
```
output:-Python is fantastic

### Ques. How to check What type of datatype?
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
|  |  |
|:----:| ---------|
|Text Type | str |
| Numeric Types | int, float, complex |
| Sequence Types | list, tuple, range |
| Mapping Type | dict
| Set Types | set, frozenset |
| Boolean Type | bool |
| Binary Types |	bytes, bytearray, memoryview |

```python
x = 5
print(type(x)) 
```
output:- <class 'int'>
